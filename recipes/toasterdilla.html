    <h2>Description</h2>
    Who knew you could make a quesadilla in your toaster? Meet the toasterdilla! They have become all the rage and can be tailored to your favorite ingredients; just be sure not to overstuff them. Once you get the hang of folding them, they are a breeze to put together and something the kids can make too. Serve with sour cream and salsa.
 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (25 cm) flour tortillas</li>
      <li>½ cup refried beans</li>
      <li>⅔ cup shredded Mexican four-cheese blend</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Lay tortillas flat on a clean work surface. Spread refried beans down the middle third from top to bottom, leaving a 1-inch space halfway down to allow for a fold. Sprinkle cheese on top, lightly pressing into the beans.</li>
      <li>Fold the left side over the beans, then the right side on top, so the two sides are overlapping in the middle. Fold in half vertically so the bottom edge meets the top edge.</li>
      <li>Place the quesadillas into the toaster slots and set the toaster to medium heat. Toast for 1 cycle. Carefully remove quesadillas and reverse the vertical fold, so that the inside is now the outside. Return to the toaster and toast until lightly browned, about half a toasting cycle.</li>
      <li>Carefully remove the hot quesadillas to a plate. Cut in half at the fold to make 4 pieces.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    You may use your favorite sliced cheese instead of shredded.

    If you accidentally overstuff or rip the tortilla, you may wrap the quesadilla in foil before toasting. However, it will not toast up as nicely. Toast for 2 to 3 cycles.
