  <h2>Description</h2>
  <div class="text">My mother first created this for our family in high school. Now that I'm on my own, I make it at least once a month. It is so comforting!</div>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <div class="text">
    1 (454 grams) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta, ½ cup butter, 2 cloves garlic (minced), ¼ cup olive oil, 1 large head green cabbage (shredded), salt and pepper to taste, 1 pound (454 grams) smoked sausage (sliced), ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese.
  </div>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol class="text">
    <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the bow tie pasta and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
    <li>Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the garlic, olive oil, and cabbage; season with salt and pepper; cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in the sausage and bow tie pasta; cook until completely heated, about 5 minutes more. Top with Parmesan cheese and serve immediately.</li>
  </ol>
